        """Integration test for main.

        This tests consolidates together the mocks built up for individual parts of the
        main function in `TestMainValid`.

        The fixture `mock_requests_get` uses monkeypatch to mock any `requests.get`
        call made in the entire test. `mock_requests_get` returns two pages of
        valid Raindrop.io API response containing a total of 26 raindrops.  Three of
        those raindrops are favourited (k: "important", v: "true").

        Of those three favourites, one ("Hacker News") already exists in the
        `mock_db_contents` fixture.

        Therefore the test should produce two newly favourite raindrops: "The Times"
        and "Amazon"

        The test itself initially arranges:

        a) a mock database json file: a tmp file in a tmp directory, using pytests's
           `tmp_path` for automatic teardown. The database is written from the
           `mock_db_contents` fixture which reads in "tests/mock_data/mock_db.json".

           `mock_db_contents` contains one processed Raindrop: Hacker News. (This
           favourite exists in the Raindrop.io API response provided by
           `mock_requests.get`).

        b) a mock temp file to provide the location of the "mock_db.json".

        c) a Mock Todoist.Task API response (which is required by `add_link_as_comment`)

        The test then calls `main.py` using a `with` context managing applying unittest
        patches to:

        1) `TodoistAPI.add_task`: a patch for the API call which returns the Mock
           Todoist Task object.

        2) `TodoistAPI.add_comment`: A patch for the API call. No return is specified.

        3) `DatabaseManager.__init__`: A patch for the `__init__`` method of any
            instance of `DatabaseManager`.  The patch overwrites the location the
            real location of the database directory, metafile directory and metafile.
            They are replaced with paths to their temp equivalents.

        Assertions
        ----------
        The assertions utilise  `call_args_list` to assert that multiple calls to
        the mocked Todoist.API.create_task endpoint were made correctly.

        Assertions check the newly found Raindrops are correctly written to the temp
        directory files using Pathlib. The files in the temp database directory are
        listed and the number of files are checked.  Then the title of the newest
        entry in the database is checked against the expected list.
